Ninjilante
==============
COSC360 Game by Team Versor


Summary:
--------
Ninjilante is a 2D stealth action game in which you control two competing ninjas
that steal and kill their way towards a common objective. The player must stealthily
navigate through large amounts of enemies by avoiding their cones of vision, to steal
priceless gems. Ninjilante will have a top-down oblique camera view, and detailed 
pixelly graphics to give it a semi-retro aesthetic.


Known Issues:
-------------
- The material on the enemy's cone of vision bugs out when the enemy returns from being
smoke-bombed or shurikened
- Bodies can be placed through walls
- Enemies have the potential to get "lost" if you lure them away from their waypoints,
stun them, and then  leave them alone
- Enemies have the potential to collide with one another and get stuck
- Enemies do not flock correctly when many of them swarm towards the player
